\subsection{The Duesseldorf Sleepy Language Corpus}

For the Continuous Sleepiness Sub-Challenge, a subset of the German SLEEP (Duesseldorf Sleepy Language) corpus was chosen~\cite{schullerinterspeech}. Audio files were recorded with 44.1~kHz and down-sampled to 16~kHz, using a 16 bit quantization. The dataset consists of both read speech and spontaneous narrative speech. 

Each participant had to report sleepiness on the well-established Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS, \cite{aakerstedt1990subjective}) with a range of 1 (extremely alert) to 9 (very sleepy). Additionally, two raters assigned post-hoc observer KSS ratings.  The scores from self assessments and the observers are averaged to form the reference sleepiness values.

\subsection{Databases for Training the i-vector Extractor}

Training the UBM and i-vector extractor requires a large database with multiple speakers. Since, we did not have access to any such database in German,
%Because the amount of data in the SLEEP corpus was not sufficient to train the UBM and i-vector extractor,a separate set of databases was used for this purpose. in this study, 
the NIST SRE 04, 05, 06, and 08 databases~\cite{alvin2004nist,przybocki2006nist,martin2009nist} and the Switchboard II corpus phase 2 data~\cite{graff1999switchboard} were used. These databases provide more than 3,000 hours of speech samples from 3,408 female and 1,832 male talkers. These databases are sampled at 8~kHz. %The databases are chosen to provide a large number of speakers to train the i-vector system which compensates for speaker variability~\cite{dehak2011front}.
